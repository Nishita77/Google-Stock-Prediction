  <!-- ABOUT PROJECT -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Stock price prediction is challenging due to the volatile and non-linear
      nature of financial markets. This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory
      (LSTM) deep learning model to predict Google stock prices based on
      historical market data.
    </p>

  <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
  <section id="problem">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional statistical models fail to capture long-term dependencies
      present in stock market data. This project addresses the limitation by
      using LSTM networks, which are capable of learning temporal patterns
      from time-series data.

  <!-- HOW MODEL WORKS -->
  <section id="working">
    <h2>How the Model Works</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Collection:</strong>
        Historical Google stock price data is collected from Yahoo Finance,
        including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
        The dataset is cleaned, normalized using MinMaxScaler, and transformed
        into 60-day time steps suitable for LSTM input.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>LSTM Model Training:</strong>
        A deep learning LSTM model is trained to learn long-term dependencies
        in stock price movements.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Prediction:</strong>
        The trained model predicts future stock prices, which are later
        compared with actual values.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results & Visualization</h2>

    <p>
      The graph below compares the actual Google stock prices with the prices
      predicted by the LSTM model. The model effectively captures the overall
      trend in stock price movements.

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion & Future Scope</h2>

    <p>
      This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM neural networks in
      time-series forecasting of stock prices. While the model performs well
      in predicting trends, it does not consider external economic or political
      factors.
