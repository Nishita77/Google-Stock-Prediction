# 📈 Google Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts Google’s stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** — a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that works great for time-series forecasting.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

The goal is to forecast Google’s stock prices based on historical data.  
We train the model using 60 previous stock prices to predict the next one.

📊 The model learns patterns and trends, and finally compares:
- **Real Prices** (red line)
- **Predicted Prices** (blue line)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🧩 **TensorFlow / Keras**
- 📘 **Pandas, NumPy**
- 📊 **Matplotlib**
- 🧮 **Scikit-learn**

---

## 🧾 Dataset
The dataset used is from **Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv** and **Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv**.

Columns include:
- Date  
- Open  
- High  
- Low  
- Close  
- Volume
